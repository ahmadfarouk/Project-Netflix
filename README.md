# Project-Netflix

Hi,
The code is created in many code files. And like many of the data analysis platforms, that uses lookup files in run time to minimize the code execution time, the code exports the data as summary or downloaded data to csv files which will be used in the next file.
The file are in order:

1- TMDB-OMDB.ipynb
2- TMDB.ipynb
3- Python-Netflix-Project-DataNormalization 2.ipynb
4- Python-Netflix-Project-DataNormalization 3.ipynb

Thanks.
